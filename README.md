# RSA SecurID Login

rsasecure_login authenticates a user to an RSA SecurID protected resource, and saves the cookie session for later use during normal Conda command operations.


## Install

For now, rsasecure_login is available via the Idaholab Conda channel:

```bash
conda config --add channels idaholab
conda install rsasecure_login
```
